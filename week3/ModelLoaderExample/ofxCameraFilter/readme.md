# ofxCameraFilter is an addon for [openFrameworks](http://openframeworks.cc/)

It is a one-shot filter/effect that works in tandem with [ofxBlur](https://github.com/kylemcdonald/ofxBlur) to create camera-like artifacts, including: vignetting, lens distortion, chromatic aberration, blur/bloom, and noise grain.

ofxCameraFilter was originally written for [Eyeshine](https://github.com/kylemcdonald/Eyeshine), a collaboration between Golan Levin and Kyle McDonald.
